            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JacaScript?</p>
            <p>
                I do not have any previous experience when it comes to client side Javascript. This is the first time
                for
                me working with client side JavaScript. It is really interesting and fun to learn about so Im happy we
                got
                this included in the course. Hopefully server side will be as much fun.
            </p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <p>
                I've only worked with Java before. JavaScript is a bit similar to Java but not to much. I think
                the biggest difference is that Java is object-oriented.
            </p>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did you code turn
                out to be?
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I started with the exercise I went to the lecture and lab for more information.
                After the lab I installed XAMPP and read some about it to understand more.
                I had som problems with the fetch so I had to find some examples and guides about it to know what to do.
                When I understood what to do I found my own municipality which is Kristianstad and used that one.
                I do aim for grade 5 but so far Im only done with the requirements for grade 3 and 4 but hopefully I
                will
                do the requirements for grade 5 as well.
            </p>
            <p>What is you TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>
                I learned a lot from this part of the course. This is the hardest so far. I learned how to create a
                moving object and
                how to hide it with the help of a timer. I learned how to fetch. I learned how to make a nice HTML
                table.
                I learned how to create flags without using an image of the flag, instead creating it with help from
                css.

            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
            <p>Before starting with this part of the course I had no experience when it comes to node/npm.
            I didn't have any experience in any equal programming tool so this is brand new for me.</p>
            <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
            <p>Working with javascript is a lot of fun even though it's new to me.
            In the beginning I didn't understand very much about node or express.
            The guides from the assignment, the preparations were very helpful to get started.</p>
            <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
            <p>First of all I went to the lecture and lab to get started.
            After the lab I did some research on how to make the requirements for the assignment.
            I found some examples and learned from that.</p>
            <p>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
            <p>My first thought was to do as much as possible.
            After starting with the assignment I realised that this is harder then expected.
            It's new stuff to learn every week so it's pretty hard to catch up with it.
            My aim was of course to get a grade as high as I possible could.
            At least I've done requirements for grade 3 but I hope to do more during the following weeks.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I've learned more about javascript during this part of the course.
            I've learned some about Node and express and also got an understanding about it.
            I've learned how to run an express application and how to run it on port 1337.
            I made a lotto that prints out a lotto draw of 7 numbers, between 1 and 35.
