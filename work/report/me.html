<h1>My report page in the course </h1>

<p><img src="img/malvakt.png" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. 
    Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is André Sandin, born and raised in Kristianstad, Skåne, 
    I was born 1993 which makes me 26 years old. 
    I've been playing a lot of sports during my childhood and still does some but nowadays it's just with friends.
    I liked to play ice-hockey, floorball and football. 
    I played floorball and hockey and attained the Österänggymnasium in Kristianstad where I studied to become a chef. 
    I've been working as a chef, construction worker, kindergarden teacher and as a sökspecialist at Eniro. 
    </p>

<p>Sport had allways been a big part of my life since both my parents are very interested in sports but something
    I haven't gotten from them is my love for computer games.</p>

<p>When I was done with school I worked for a couple of years before I decided to go for a backpacking trip in Asia
    where I was for 3 months, during that time I stayed in Indonesia, Cambodja, Vietnam, Singapore and different parents
    of Thailand.</p>

<p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
