<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I've worked with github before in earlier projects.</p>
<p>I haven't worked with markdown before.</p>
<p>The only thing with git i've worked with is the github webpage, git bash and github desktop.</p>
<p>This is the first time working with websites, very exciting.</p>
<p>I don't have very much experience when it comes to web application development.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to learn how to create web applications.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to learn more about developing web applications.</p>
<p>My experience with git has been very basic before.</p>
<p>I've updated my memory when it comes to git thanks to Mikael.</p>
<p>Today I learned a lot more about github that I didn't know before.</p>
<p>Today I learned how to fork a repo.</p>
<p>Today I learned what kind of texteditor I need to use for this course.</p>
<p>Today I learned how to setup a website using github.</p>
