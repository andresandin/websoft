<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I've worked with github before in earlier projects.
    I haven't worked with markdown before.
    The only thing with git i've worked with is the github webpage, git bash and github desktop.
    This is the first time working with websites, very exciting.
    I don't have very much experience when it comes to web application development.
    I've always wanted to learn how to create web applications.
    I'm looking forward to learn more about developing web applications.
    My experience with git has been very basic before.
    I've updated my memory when it comes to git thanks to Mikael.
    Today I learned a lot more about github that I didn't know before.
    Today I learned how to fork a repo.
    Today I learned what kind of texteditor I need to use for this course.
    Today I learned how to setup a website using github.
    Today I learned how to attach a tag to my work.
    I'm very excited to learn more from this course.
    This course will be fun.</p>
