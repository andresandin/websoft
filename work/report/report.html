<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JacaScript?</p>
<p>
I do not have any previous experience when it comes to client side Javascript. This is the first time for
me working with client side JavaScript. It is really interesting and fun to learn about so Im happy we got
this included in the course. Hopefully server side will be as much fun.
</p>
<p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
<p>
I've only worked with Java before. JavaScript is a bit similar to Java but not to much. I think
the biggest difference is that Java is object-oriented.
</p>
<p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did you code turn
    out to be?
</p>
<p>
Before I started with the exercise I went to the lecture and lab for more information.
After the lab I installed XAMPP and read some about it to understand more.
I had som problems with the fetch so I had to find some examples and guides about it to know what to do.
When I understood what to do I found my own municipality which is Kristianstad and used that one.
I do aim for grade 5 but so far Im only done with the requirements for grade 3 and 4 but hopefully I will 
do the requirements for grade 5 as well.
</p>
<p>What is you TIL for this course section?</p>
<p>
I learned a lot from this part of the course. This is the hardest so far. I learned how to create a moving object and
how to hide it with the help of a timer. I learned how to fetch. I learned how to make a nice HTML table. 
I learned how to create flags without using an image of the flag, instead creating it with help from css.

    <h2>S04</h2>
    <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
    <p>Before starting with this part of the course I had no experience when it comes to node/npm. 
        I didn't have any experience in any equal programming tool so this is brand new for me.</p>
    <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
    <p>Working with javascript is a lot of fun even though it's new to me. 
        In the beginning I didn't understand very much about node or express.
        The guides from the assignment, the preparations were very helpful to get started.</p>
    <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
    <p>First of all I went to the lecture and lab to get started.
        After the lab I did some research on how to make the requirements for the assignment.
        I found some examples and learned from that.</p>
    <p>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
    <p>My first thought was to do as much as possible.
        After starting with the assignment I realised that this is harder then expected.
        It's new stuff to learn every week so it's pretty hard to catch up with it.
        My aim was of course to get a grade as high as I possible could.
        At least I've done requirements for grade 3 but I hope to do more during the following weeks.</p>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>I've learned more about javascript during this part of the course.
        I've learned some about Node and express and also got an understanding about it.
        I've learned how to run an express application and how to run it on port 1337.
        I made a lotto that prints out a lotto draw of 7 numbers, between 1 and 35.</p>

    <h2>S05</h2>
    <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
    <p>PHP felt very strange but it feels very good to get to know it. I like that you can do like "shortcuts",
        as we did with headers and footers, makes the code much more nice. There is a lot of help online if 
        problems occur and I think that is very good so you don't get stuck for too long before you manage to solve
        the problem. 
    </p>
    <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
    <p>PHP is different from the languages I know. It's a bit similar and some parts are easy to understand but the way
        it's written is very odd compared with all the dollar-signs. 
        As I've understand it, PHP is mostly like C and I have no experienced when it comes to that language.
    </p>
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
    <p>First of all, my goal was to manage grade 3 for this exercise. After completing all parts for grade 3 
        I thought grade 4 wasn't to hard so I did that part as well.
    At the beginning of this exercise I first decided which database to use, I used the mysqldb from XAMPP.
    I started by creating the database and added all information I needed for this exercise.
    When the database was completed I had some problems with the connection and couldn't understand what the problem was but
    after some google searches and help from the examples I managed to fix my problems.
    Im satisfied with the result because everything is working fine.</p>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>I've gotten a better understanding when it comes to the programming language PHP, would be weird
        otherwise because it's the first time working with it :).
        I've learned how to make a HTML-file to an PHP-file.
        I've learned how to include a file to the different pages in a efficient way(headers and footers in this case).
        I used an auto incremented integer as primary key.
        Got more knowledge when it comes to PHP-Database connection.

    <h2>S06</h2>
    <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of
         future popularity among programming languages?</p>
    <p>
        My own opinion on popularity of programming languages is that the ones that have been around the longest probably is the most popular and developed ones.
        In the future the most popular ones will be those that is the easiest to learn. 
        Which language that will the most popular in the future I don't know, but as for now on I know that you have programming 
        classes in an earlier ages, my younger cousin had it in secondary school.
    </p>
    <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
    <p>
    I don't really know yet. I guess I need more experience to answer what future programming language I would select. 
    Right now I'm learning C# for my degree project so maybe that but only the future can tell.
    </p>
    <p>Do your own investigations on https://trends.google.com to customize your own comparison on
        programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.
    </p>
    <p>
    For my investigation I compared programming languages Java and PHP. The most popular was as I expected, 
    Java is more popular. In Indonesia for the last 12 months PHP is more popular, with 56% versus Javas 44%. Even in Thailand
    PHP is very popular where the standings are 50/50 but except those two countries Java is more popular.
    But that comparison is just for the last 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer
        and your next large project, what would it be and how would you "sell it"?
    </p>
    <p>
    I don't have a lot of experience yet so this is a hard one. If I had to pick one it would maybe be JavaScript because
    I like it even though this is the first course I've been working with it. I don't really know how I would sell it.
    </p>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>
    My TIL for this section is the comparison between Java and PHP. I thought that Java was more popular than PHP but I 
    didn't know by how much before.

    <h2>S07</h2>
    <p>Try to explain the platform .NET (#C, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
    <p>
    .NET is a framework for building and running many different applications. You can build for example consoleapplications and webapplications.
    C# is a programming language which is object-oriented. C# is a part of .NET so its used alongside languages like ASP in web development.
    ASP.NET works on top of the HTTP protocol.
    </p>
    <p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
    <p>
    .NET is the hardest one of the technologies we have been using during this course. It's very complex and there is a lot to learn about it.
    
    </p>
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
    <p>
    I started by watching most of the video series linked on canvas. I started by doing the webapplication because
    it seemed to me that it was the hardest one. I watched your videos on youtube and later on managed to complete that part of the exercise.
    I finished by doing the consoleapplication. I aimed for grade 3 due to lack of time. Im satisifed that I manage to get it done but if there was more time
    I would aim for a higher grade.
    </p>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>
    I learned how the basics works for .NET/ASP.NET. 
    I learned how to create new projects with ASP.NET.
    It was pretty hard to find information about this platform but fortunately the examples helped me a lot.
