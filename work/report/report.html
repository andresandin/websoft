                Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
                Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
                What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I have a very basic experience when it comes to HTML.</p>
            <p>I do not have any previous experience regarding CSS.</p>
            <p>The only experience I have regarding JavaScript is a couple of youtube videos.</p>

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JacaScript?</p>
            <p>
                I do not have any previous experience when it comes to client side Javascript. This is the first time
                for
                me working with client side JavaScript. It is really interesting and fun to learn about so Im happy we
                got
                this included in the course. Hopefully server side will be as much fun.
            </p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <p>
                I've only worked with Java before. JavaScript is a bit similar to Java but not to much. I think
                the biggest difference is that Java is object-oriented.
            </p>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did you code turn
                out to be?
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I started with the exercise I went to the lecture and lab for more information.
                After the lab I installed XAMPP and read some about it to understand more.
                I had som problems with the fetch so I had to find some examples and guides about it to know what to do.
                When I understood what to do I found my own municipality which is Kristianstad and used that one.
                I do aim for grade 5 but so far Im only done with the requirements for grade 3 and 4 but hopefully I
                will
                do the requirements for grade 5 as well.
            </p>
            <p>What is you TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>
                I learned a lot from this part of the course. This is the hardest so far. I learned how to create a
                moving object and
                how to hide it with the help of a timer. I learned how to fetch. I learned how to make a nice HTML
                table.
                I learned how to create flags without using an image of the flag, instead creating it with help from
                css.

            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
            <p>Before starting with this part of the course I had no experience when it comes to node/npm.
                I didn't have any experience in any equal programming tool so this is brand new for me.</p>
            <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
            <p>Working with javascript is a lot of fun even though it's new to me.
                In the beginning I didn't understand very much about node or express.
                The guides from the assignment, the preparations were very helpful to get started.</p>
            <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
            <p>First of all I went to the lecture and lab to get started.
                After the lab I did some research on how to make the requirements for the assignment.
                I found some examples and learned from that.</p>
            <p>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
            <p>My first thought was to do as much as possible.
                After starting with the assignment I realised that this is harder then expected.
                It's new stuff to learn every week so it's pretty hard to catch up with it.
                My aim was of course to get a grade as high as I possible could.
                At least I've done requirements for grade 3 but I hope to do more during the following weeks.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I've learned more about javascript during this part of the course.
                I've learned some about Node and express and also got an understanding about it.
                I've learned how to run an express application and how to run it on port 1337.
                I made a lotto that prints out a lotto draw of 7 numbers, between 1 and 35.</p>

            <h2>S05</h2>
            <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
            <p>PHP felt very strange but it feels very good to get to know it. I like that you can do like "shortcuts",
                as we did with headers and footers, makes the code much more nice. There is a lot of help online if
                problems occur and I think that is very good so you don't get stuck for too long before you manage to
                solve
                the problem.
            </p>
            <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
            <p>PHP is different from the languages I know. It's a bit similar and some parts are easy to understand but
                the way
                it's written is very odd compared with all the dollar-signs.
                As I've understand it, PHP is mostly like C and I have no experienced when it comes to that language.
            </p>
            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the
                result?</p>
            <p>First of all, my goal was to manage grade 3 for this exercise. After completing all parts for grade 3
                I thought grade 4 wasn't to hard so I did that part as well.
                At the beginning of this exercise I first decided which database to use, I used the mysqldb from XAMPP.
                I started by creating the database and added all information I needed for this exercise.
                When the database was completed I had some problems with the connection and couldn't understand what the
                problem was but
                after some google searches and help from the examples I managed to fix my problems.
                Im satisfied with the result because everything is working fine.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I've gotten a better understanding when it comes to the programming language PHP, would be weird
                otherwise because it's the first time working with it :).
                I've learned how to make a HTML-file to an PHP-file.
                I've learned how to include a file to the different pages in a efficient way(headers and footers in this
                case).
                I used an auto incremented integer as primary key.
                Got more knowledge when it comes to PHP-Database connection.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of
                future popularity among programming languages?</p>
            <p>
                My own opinion on popularity of programming languages is that the ones that have been around the longest
                probably is the most popular and developed ones.
                In the future the most popular ones will be those that is the easiest to learn.
                Which language that will the most popular in the future I don't know, but as for now on I know that you
                have programming
                classes in an earlier ages, my younger cousin had it in secondary school.
            </p>
            <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
            <p>
                I don't really know yet. I guess I need more experience to answer what future programming language I
                would select.
                Right now I'm learning C# for my degree project so maybe that but only the future can tell.
            </p>
            <p>Do your own investigations on https://trends.google.com to customize your own comparison on
                programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my investigation I compared programming languages Java and PHP. The most popular was as I expected,
                Java is more popular. In Indonesia for the last 12 months PHP is more popular, with 56% versus Javas
                44%. Even in Thailand
                PHP is very popular where the standings are 50/50 but except those two countries Java is more popular.
                But that comparison is just for the last 12 months.
            </p>
            <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer
                and your next large project, what would it be and how would you "sell it"?
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't have a lot of experience yet so this is a hard one. If I had to pick one it would maybe be
                JavaScript because
                I like it even though this is the first course I've been working with it. I don't really know how I
                would sell it.
            </p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>
                My TIL for this section is the comparison between Java and PHP. I thought that Java was more popular
                than PHP but I
                didn't know by how much before.

            <p>Try to explain the platform .NET (#C, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft
                technology.</p>
            <p>
                .NET is a framework for building and running many different applications. You can build for example
                consoleapplications and webapplications.
                C# is a programming language which is object-oriented. C# is a part of .NET so its used alongside
                languages like ASP in web development.
                ASP.NET works on top of the HTTP protocol.
            </p>
            <p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
            <p>
                .NET is the hardest one of the technologies we have been using during this course. It's very complex and
                there is a lot to learn about it.

            </p>
            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the
                result?</p>
            <p>
                I started by watching most of the video series linked on canvas. I started by doing the webapplication
                because
                it seemed to me that it was the hardest one. I watched your videos on youtube and later on managed to
                complete that part of the exercise.
                I finished by doing the consoleapplication. I aimed for grade 3 due to lack of time. Im satisifed that I
                manage to get it done but if there was more time
                I would aim for a higher grade.
            </p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>
                I learned how the basics works for .NET/ASP.NET.
                I learned how to create new projects with ASP.NET.
                It was pretty hard to find information about this platform but fortunately the examples helped me a lot.

            <h2>S08</h2>
            <p>Myself and Hashim Veseli decided to analyze three equal social media websites to be able to see how they
                differ and which one stands out and why. We chose these three social media giants because they are very
                popular and we feel like they need to have high performance. It will be interesting comparing the
                performance of these three websites. </p>
            <p>Devtool Network tab analysis can be found <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYnfV1c1aMznVcffMicaet_SPyzsbMhyrDhK_ipEdAA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
                <p>PageSight Analysis of the three social media giants Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, you find <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjiEpW-DaVZZ6rMs-1BMzeSaQNKlLGZ3zBcatoI9Ajs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instagram.com gets the best performance score where basically the only
                    downside is the formats of the pictures need to be more modern. </p>
                <p>LightHouse Analysis of Facebook you find <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vpi67_nioqfvWtB969oaECapwtar58bMvzglE9I1KD4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Facebook.com has the worst performance of the three. We can see that time
                    for the page to become fully interactive is almost 1 minute! Slow speed index and first CPU idle.
                    Could save a lot of time if images and formats are fixed along with minimizing main thread. The page
                    is not fast enough for mobile networks and does not provide a response 200 when page is offline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> So, Instagram.com has a fast and reliable page load on mobile networks but
                    does not provide a respond with a 200 when a page is offline. Also it does not provide any fallback
                    content when JavaScript is not available and could save some performance time if it efficiently
                    could encode images and serve images in next-gen formats. Also, reducing the impact of third party
                    code and minimizing main-thread work would increase performance. </p>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As we can see with Twitter.com, the page load is not fast enough on mobile
                    networks. The page load is too slow and not interactive within 10 seconds mosly because of overload
                    on the main thread and on the JavaScript execution time. That is the main reason the performance is
                    bad on this website. Then there are other aspects as reducing the impact of third party code and
                    avoiding enormous network payloads. </p>

            <p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issuses or concerns, 
                from your own experience, 
            related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
            <p>
            I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to different security issues or concerns. When I was younger someone tried to 
            hack my email-account but that's pretty much it. After reading about OWASP Top Ten I would say that Security Misconfiguration might be one
            that fits me, my strength isn't security when I develop something. Sensitive Data Exposure is another concern. You don't
            want your data to be exposed for everyone. 
            Broken Authentication is another concern. I wouldn't want an attacker to get my password or other information about me.

            <p>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic
                "The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications".</p>
            <p>
            Some guidelines to a new web programmer could be to implement proper logging. Another one is to follow the OWASP Top Ten. 
            Take the time to think about the security for the web application, what suits your application. Encrypt everything.

            <p>
            I've learned about the top ten application security risks from OWASP.

<p>Write a general paragraph about how the project was implemented. 
Problems / solutions / simple / difficult / fast / long time, etc. Was the project easy or difficult? 
Did it take a long time? What was difficult and what went easy? 
Was this a good and reasonable project for this course? How was it to work in a team?</p>
<p>
I did the project with Anton and Hashim, first we spent some time to decide what we were going to do and how to do it. 
We decided to do a to-do application and that Anton was going to handle the back-end while me and Hashim took care of the front-end. 
We used MySQL to create our database and ASP.NET and C# for the application. 
At first we talked about using react for this project but because none of us had any previous experience we decided to not use it and instead code it as we learned during the course. 
I feel that it went pretty slow in the start of the project but when we got a hang of it everything was done quick and smooth. 
We had some problems along the way but nothing we couldn’t solve together in the team. 
The project started out a little difficult due to the experience we had but turned out easier later on. 
I think the difficult part was that ASP.NET and C# was new to us and that’s why the start was a bit slow and the easy part was when we had managed to create the base to build on. 
I think this was a reasonable project for this course for sure. 
I’ve been working with the same team before and we have become really good friends during our time in school and I always enjoy working with them.

Finish with a final paragraph with your thoughts on the course and what you think about the material and the guide (about 5-10 sentences). 
Provide feedback to teachers and suggest any improvement suggestions for upcoming course opportunities. 
Are you satisfied / dissatisfied? Will you recommend the course to your friends / colleagues? 
On a scale of 1-10, what grade do you give the course?</p>
<p>
I really liked the structure of this course, I think it’s very good with assignments every week so that the student can learn by doing even though some weeks was a lot harder than others. 
It was very good that there was example code for every task because when I didn’t understand what to do the examples helped me with the understanding of the assignment. 
Some weeks it felt like it could be too much depending on the assignment, some of them was a lot harder than others but it might also be because we are doing our thesis at the same time as we had this course. 
I’m satisfied with this course and I would absolutely recommend it, as I said I really liked the structure, I think it’s a great way to learn. 
It was also very good that even if we missed a lecture we could watch it on YouTube after. 
On a scale 1-10 I would give this course 8-9 I think but it could certainly be higher if we had more time between every assignment.</p>
<p>
What is your final TIL for this course?</p>
<p>
My TIL for this course was a lot, we learned new things every week.
Everything I know about javascript, html and css I learned during this course.</p>
